👋 Hi, I’m Akash Sukumar
👀 I’m interested in creating applications using containers.
🌱 This is a voting application created by me using containers.
💞️ I have creating Vote casting page using Flask and the casted votes are stored in postgres DB which is then accessed by Result page created using node.js
📫 The Docker compose file and the Vote page & Result page are added
Future Changes expected.
